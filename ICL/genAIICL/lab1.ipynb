Instead of using one-hot encoding which is inefficient, it maps integer indices directly to dense vectors. Under the hood, it functions similarly to a large `nn.Parameter` matrix where each row represents an item, but it's optimized for retrieving and updating specific rows based on input indices.\n",

This is essential when you need to iterate over layers, store collections of similar blocks, or build networks with variable depth. Unlike regular lists, ModuleList ensures parameter tracking works correctly. So please remember not to use a plain Python list in the `__init__` function to organize `nn.Module`, because it will not be registered as submodules.\n",

        "\n",
        "Now that we have a Dataset, we need a **DataLoader**. If the Dataset is a map, the DataLoader is the delivery truck. It grabs items from your Dataset, groups them into batches, and delivers them to your training loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why do we need it? Because training on one sample at a time is slow. We want to process data in batches, and we want to load the next batch while the GPU is busy processing the current one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is how the DataLoader works and the key parameters you need to know:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Workers (`num_workers`)**:\n",
        "    *   The DataLoader can spawn multiple sub-processes (workers) to call your `__getitem__` method in parallel.\n",
        "    *   If `num_workers=0`, the main process does everything (slow).\n",
        "    *   If `num_workers=4`, four separate processes are reading files and processing data simultaneously. This is why we put the heavy work in `__getitem__`—so these workers can share the load!\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Batch Size (`batch_size`)**:\n",
        "    *   This determines how many samples are stacked together into a single tensor before being sent to the model. Larger batches can speed up training but require more GPU memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Memory Pinning (`pin_memory=True`)**:\n",
        "    *   This is a common point of confusion. Setting this to `True` does **not** automatically move data to the GPU.\n",
        "    *   Instead, it allocates the data in a special type of CPU memory (page-locked memory) that is faster to copy to the GPU.\n",
        "    *   **The Workflow**: The workers load data to CPU RAM → `pin_memory` locks it in a special CPU buffer → You manually call `.to('cuda')` in your loop, which happens much faster because the memory is pinned.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Prefetch Factor**:\n",
        "    *   This controls how many batches each worker loads in advance. It ensures that when the GPU finishes a batch, the next one is already waiting at the door, minimizing the time the GPU sits idle.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Shuffling (`shuffle=True`)**:\n",
        "    *   This is critical for training. It randomizes the order of samples every epoch.\n",
        "    *   **Why?** If you feed the model data in the same order every time (e.g., all \"Cats\" then all \"Dogs\"), the model might learn patterns based on the *order* rather than the content, leading to poor generalization.\n",
        "    *   *Note: For validation or testing, we usually set `shuffle=False` because the order doesn't affect the metric calculation, and it helps to compare results consistently.*\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Dropping the Last Batch (`drop_last=True`)**:\n",
        "    *   Often, your dataset size isn't perfectly divisible by the `batch_size`. This leaves a \"leftover\" batch at the end that is smaller than the rest.\n",
        "    *   **Why drop it?** Some layers (like Batch Normalization) behave unstably or crash if they receive a batch with only 1 sample. Also, having a variable batch size can mess up metric calculations or hardware optimization. Setting `drop_last=True` simply discards those few remaining samples to ensure every batch has the exact same shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary: The **Dataset** defines *how* to read a single item, and the **DataLoader** organizes *how* to grab many items efficiently using parallel workers."

        "    *   **What it does**: It introduces a **velocity** term, let's call it $v_t$, which is a moving average of past gradients. Instead of just using the current gradient, we use this velocity to update the parameters.\n",

        "The standard way to save things in PyTorch is with `torch.save`. But **what** exactly should you save?\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Saving the Model's State (`state_dict`)**\n",
        "    *   The best practice is **not** to save the entire model object. Instead, save its **`state_dict`**.\n",
        "    *   **What is a `state_dict`?** It's a simple Python dictionary that maps each layer to its learnable parameters (weights and biases). It's clean, lightweight, and portable.\n",
        "    *   **How to save:** `torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')`\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Saving the Optimizer's State**\n",
        "    *   If you plan to **resume training**, you must also save the optimizer's state.\n",
        "    *   **Why?** The optimizer's `state_dict` contains its internal buffers and parameters, like the momentum values in SGD or the running averages in Adam. Without these, you're not truly resuming; you're starting the optimization process from scratch.\n",
        "    *   **How to save:** `torch.save(optimizer.state_dict(), 'optimizer.pth')`\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Saving the Full State for Reproducibility**\n",
        "    *   For most simple experiments, saving the model and optimizer is enough. For quick tests, you might even get away with just saving the model.\n",
        "    *   However, when dealing with large-scale models or when strict **reproducibility** is required, you need to control every source of randomness. This means saving more than just weights.\n",
        "    *   In advanced scenarios, you also save the state of:\n",
        "        *   **The DataLoader**: This can be surprisingly detailed. It includes not just the random seed for shuffling, but potentially even which worker is processing which batch.\n",
        "        *   **Random Number Generators (RNGs)**: You need to save the state of every RNG you use. The common ones are `torch` (for CPU), `torch.cuda` (for GPU), Python's built-in `random`, and `numpy.random`.\n",
        "    *   Why go through all this trouble? These details, while seeming minor, are critical for ensuring that if you stop and restart a training run, it continues from the *exact* same state. In large-scale distributed training, for example, we might generate a specific random number for each GPU at each step, ensuring every random operation in the training loop is traceable and repeatable.\n",
        "    *   We won't require you to implement this level of detail in this tutorial, but it's crucial to know that saving just the model and optimizer is often not enough to perfectly preserve and resume a training state.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Loading the State**\n",
        "\n",
        "So, we've covered saving. How do we load the state back? The process is straightforward but has one critical rule: you must first create an instance of your model and optimizer *before* you can load their states. The saved `state_dict` only contains the parameters, not the model's architecture itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have your empty model and optimizer objects, you use `torch.load()` to read the checkpoint file from disk. Then, you call the `.load_state_dict()` method on your model and optimizer to populate them with the saved weights and internal states."

        "2.  **Adjust Learning Rate (Optional)**:\n",
        "    Next, as we discussed in section 3.2.4, you might need to manually adjust the learning rate. This is a good place to do it—right at the start of an iteration. This ensures the optimizer will use the updated learning rate for the current step. For example, you might implement a learning rate warmup or a decay schedule based on the current iteration or epoch number.\n",

        "4.  **Calculate the Loss**:\n",
